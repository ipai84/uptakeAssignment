# uptakeAssignment
This project is a Page Object Model implementation of www.uptake.com . 
Some functions like checkURLHTTPStatus(URL) could not be used as current response code is always 403. 
(this was just a smoke test to check if environment is stable for testing before asserts start)
The code is in Selenium - Webdriver with Junit.
